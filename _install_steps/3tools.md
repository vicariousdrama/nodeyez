# Setting up Common Tools

If you installed Nodeyez using the [Quick Start]({% link _install_steps/0quickstart.md %}), then this step is already done for you and you can skip ahead to setting up the [Slideshow]({% link _install_steps/6slideshow.md %}) or using the [Nodeyez-Config]({% link _install_steps/9nodeyezconfig.md %}) tool.

You will need to be logged into your system with a privileged user that can perform super user operations.

If you are using a Raspberry Pi setup, you can login as these user names

- MyNodeBTC: ssh as admin
- Raspiblitz ssh as admin
- Raspibolt: ssh as admin
- Umbrel: ssh as umbrel
- Default Raspbian: ssh as pi

## Install Python3

For Raspberry Pi it'll normally come with Python 2.7, but the scripts require Python 3.  

You can esure you have Python 3 by running the following

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-venv
```

## Install Git

In future steps you'll use Git to clone this repo.

```shell
sudo apt install git
```

## Install Tor

Tor is optionally used by some scripts that retrieve data from external sources in a privacy preserving way.

```shell
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-tor
```

## Install JPEG Development Library

This library is referenced by Pillow, a python module we'll install in the next section used by the scripts for working with and rendering 2D graphics.

```shell
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev
```

## Install ImageMagic and Inkscape

These libraries are used for some of the image file type conversions

```shell
sudo apt-get install imagemagick inkscape
```

## Install JQ

This provides for JSON processing
```shell
sudo apt-get install jq
```

## Install Netcat

Provides for network connection calls used by Miner tools
```shell
sudo apt-get install netcat
```

## Install Uncomplicated Firewall Rules

This provides for a convenient wrapper around iptables for network rules

```shell
UFW_PATH=$(which ufw)
if [ -z "$UFW_PATH" ]; then
  echo "installing and initializing ufw..."
  sudo apt-get -y install ufw
  sudo ufw default deny incoming
  sudo ufw default allow outgoing
  sudo ufw allow ssh
  sudo ufw logging off
  sudo ufw enable
fi
```

## Install Fail2Ban

Prevent brute force login attempts by rejecting for time after too many successive failed logins

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install fail2ban
```
