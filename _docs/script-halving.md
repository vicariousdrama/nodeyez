# Halving Countdown

This script will query the local bitcoin node and prepare an image representing
the progress towards the next subsidy halving depicted as a progress bar, and 
each block mined within the current whole number percent.  Since a halving period
is 210000 blocks, each whole percent represents 2100 blocs making for a nice layout.
