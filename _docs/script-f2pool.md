# F2 Pool

The script prepares an image summarizing recent 24 hour summary for an F2 Pool
account.  The current hashrate is depicted, along with a graph showing the
hashrate over the past 24 hours.  Earnings information for the preceding and
current day are also rendered.  

You must have an F2 Pool account and set the account name in the configuration
file.
