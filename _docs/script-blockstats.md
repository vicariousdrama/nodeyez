# Block Stats

This script prepares an image displaying stats for the current or specified block height.  
It depends on a bitcoin node running locally and fully synched.

![sample image of stats for block 7779148](../images/blockstats.png)

An additional image can be produced to graph fee rates over time

![sample image of fee rates from block 778668 to 779148](../images/blockstats-feerates.png)

An additional image can be produced to graph segwit prevalence over time

![sample image of segwit prevalence from block 778668 to 779148](../images/blockstats-segwit.png)

## Script Location

The script is installed at 
[~/nodeyez/scripts/blockstats.py](../scripts/blockstats.py).
