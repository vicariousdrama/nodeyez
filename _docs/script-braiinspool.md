# Braiins Mining Pool

This script is useful if you have a Braiins (previously known as Slushpool)
mining pool account. To use it, you'll want to add a profile for monitoring
with read access. You can do that on the [Access Profiles page](https://pool.braiins.com/settings/access/). 
The Limited read-only permission is sufficient for the API calls made.

The pricing and profitability estimates are based on a steady load with no
variance in hashrate and does not take into account change in market price
over time or difficulty adjustments.  This feature will likely be removed
from this panel in future updates.
