# Channel Fees

This script prepares an image depicting your node's lightning channel routing
velocity and earned fees.  This is initially a basic table listing and will
likely evolve in the future.  Multiple images may be created depending on the
number of open channels.  It depends on a lighting node.

## Script Location

The script is installed at 
[~/nodeyez/scripts/channelfees.py](../scripts/channelfees.py).

## Configuration

To configure this script, edit the `~/nodeyez/config/channelfees.json` file

Fields are defined below

| field name | description |
| --- | --- |
| outputFile | The path to save the generated image. Default `../imageoutput/channelfees.png` |
| colorTextFG | The color of the text expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#ffffff` |
| colorNodeOffline | The color of the text for an offline node expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#ffa500` |
| colorNodeDead | The color of the text for a node that has been offline for 1008 blocks expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#ff0000` |
| colorBackground | The background color of the image expressed as a hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#000000` |
| colorRowBG1 | The primary color to use as the background for data rows expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#404040` |
| colorRowBG2 | The alternate color to use as the background for data rows expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#202020` |
| colorRowFG1 | The color of the text for data rows on primary color background expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#ffffff` |
| colorRowFG2 | The color of the text for data rows on alternate color background expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. Default `#ffffff` |
| width | The width, in pixels, to generate the image. Default `480` |
| height | The height, in pixels, to generate the image. Default `320` |
| sleepInterval | The amount of time, in seconds, the script should wait before data gathering and image creation again. Default `1800` |
| pageSize | The number of channels to represent per page rendered. Default `8` |
| headerText | The text to use in the header area. Default `Lightning Channel Balances` |
| nodes | An array collection of defined nodes to have channel balances reported via rest calls. If this is not provided, then the RPC calls will be made using $

###__nodes__

| field name | description |
| --- | --- |
| enabled | Inidicates whether this node definition is enabled for reporting. If set to false, it will be skipped. |
| address | The address or hostname for this node. It must be reachable from the server running the script. |
| port | The port for which the target node is listening for REST based calls. This is the port referenced in the restlisten setting in bitcoin.conf. |
| useTor | Indicates whether calls to the target node should be made over tor. For internal addresses, this should be set to false. |
| macaroon | The macaroon to use when communicating with the node in hex format. Requires permissions for uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/GetInfo uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/GetNodeInfo uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/ListChannels uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/ChannelBalance uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/ForwardingHistory uri:/lnrpc.Lightning/ListPayments. If you were using nodeyez on the target node you may use its nodeyez.macaroon created for that node. To get the hex value, you may use the command: `xxd -ps -u -c 1000 nodeyez.macaroon` |
| __optional__ | __these fields are optional to override the settings above__ |
| outputFile | Override the path to save the generated image. |
| colorTextFG | Override the color of the text expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorNodeOffline | Override the color of the text for an offline node expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorNodeDead | Override the color of the text for a node that has been offline for 1008 blocks expressed as a Hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorBackground | Override the background color of the image expressed as a hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorBarOutline | Override the color of the outline for the channel balance bar expressed as a hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorBarFilled | Override the color of the filled portion representing the local balance of the channel expressed as a hexadecimal color specifier. |
| colorBarEmpty | Override the color of the unfilled portion representing the remote balance of the channel expressed as a hexadecimal color specifier. |
| displayBalances | Indicates whether local and remote channel balance amounts should be rendered along with proportional bar. |
| width | Override the width, in pixels, to generate the image. |
| height | Override the height, in pixels, to generate the image. |
| pageSize | Override the number of channels to represent per page rendered. |
| headerText | Override the text to use in the header area. |
