## Raspberry Pi Node

To use some of the the scripts in this project, you'll need a Bitcoin Node.

An easy low cost option is a Raspberry Pi based node. Consider following the 
helpful guidance at [node.guide](https://node.guide) on different nodes 
available.

Many of the scripts can be run without a Bitcoin node though, so if you're just
looking to setup the display of the current date, the sats per usd, or gas 
prices, you just need a basic Raspberry Pi already setup with the operating
system.

The remainder of this guide assumes that you will be doing the commands on
a raspberry pi with an operating system that uses systemd.
