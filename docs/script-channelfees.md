## Channel Fees

This script prepares an image depicting your node's lightning channel routing
velocity and earned fees.  This is initially a basic table listing and will
likely evolve in the future.  Multiple images may be created depending on the
number of open channels.  The script is installed at [/home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts/channelfees.py](../scripts/channelfees.py).
It depends on a lighting node.
