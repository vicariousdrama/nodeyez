## Difficulty Epoch

This script will query the local bitcoin node and prepare an image representing
the number of blocks that have been mined thus far in the current difficulty
epoch, and indicate if the pace is ahead of schedule or behind, with an 
estimated difficulty adjustment to occur when the next epoch begins. Each
difficulty epoch consists of 2016 blocks. The script is installed at
[/home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts/difficultyepoch.py](../scripts/difficultyepoch.py).
It depends on a bitcoin node running locally and fully synched.
