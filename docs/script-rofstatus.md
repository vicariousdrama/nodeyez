## Ring of Fire Status

The Ring of Fire script provides renderings of configured Lightning Ring of Fire
groups.  If you have a lightning node and participate in a Ring of Fire, you can
configure the pubkeys for each node in the preordained sequence and the script 
will provide a useful image showing its present state.  

Offline nodes may be colored differently and have rings around them to draw 
attention.  Node operator contact list appears to the right of the ring.  You 
can define as many ring of fire configurations as you want, and each can have 
unique colors, labels, and fonts. To avoid spamming the lightning network with
connection attempts, there is a delay between each ring being processed.

The script is installed at [/home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts/rofstatus.py](../scripts/rofstatus.py)
