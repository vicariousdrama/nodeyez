## Miner - MicroBT

This script is useful if you have one or more Bitcoin miners running CGMiner
on a MicroBT Whatsminer.  It prepares an image showing the power, temperature,
fan and pool info along with a graph of the hashrate produced overtime with
moving average and warning thresholds.  It was created with a Whatsminer M20S,
and the hope is to improve for other miners over time.

From API port 4028 on the miner it uses the data from pools+summary+devs

The script is installed at [/home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts/minermicrobt.py](../scripts/minermicrobt.py).

![sample image of miner status](../images/minermicrobt.png)

* To run this script

   ```sh
   cd /home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts
   /home/nodeyez/nodeyez/scripts/minermicrobt.py
   ```

   Press CTRL+C to stop the process

* To configure this script

   Override the default configuration as follows

   ```sh
   nano /home/nodeyez/nodeyez/config/minermicrobt.json
   ```

   You must set the address for the miner
