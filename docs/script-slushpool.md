## Slushpool Mining Pool

This script is useful if you have a Slushpool mining pool account. To use it,
you'll want to add a profile for monitoring with read access. You can do that
on the [Access Profiles page](https://slushpool.com/settings/access/). The 
Limited read-only permission is sufficient for the API calls made.

from this panel in future updates.
