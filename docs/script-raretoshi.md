## Raretoshi

This script provides for a local rendering of NFTs posted to [Raretoshi](https://raretoshi.com/market)
with overlays showing the title of the work, author, edition and owner info.
Files downloaded are stored locally as a pseudo IPFS cache to conserve bandwidth.
Only static PNG and JPEG files are supported at this time.
